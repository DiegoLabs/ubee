# Ugly Bot (UBee)

This is honestly probably not going to be very useful to the normal user. This is a
Discord Bot to accompany the [PHPUgly Podcast](https://phpugly.com).

You are welcome to use, play with, or contribute back to the codebase. 

## Ideas for future commands 

* !factcheck - Highlight a correction from discord about something said during the show. Include a random `fact check` giphy.
* !showprep - Create Trello List, Update title, create recording service entry
* !episodesearch - Search past shows for a phrase.
